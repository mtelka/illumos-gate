 * Generic hash table walker
 *
 * Generic hash table is an array of head structures starting at address
 * array_addr. The number of the head structures in the array is array_len.
 * Size of the head structure is head_size. There is a pointer in the head
 * structure called first_name with offset first_offset that points to the
 * linked list of member structures. The member structure type name is stored
 * in member_type_name.  Size of the member structure is member_size. The
 * member structure have a pointer to the next member structure at offset
 * next_offset.
 *
 * A pointer to the hash_table_walk_arg_t should be passed as walk_arg to the
 * hash_table_walk_init().
